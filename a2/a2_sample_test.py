Assignment 2 - Sample Tests

This code is provided solely for the personal and private use of
students taking the CSC148 course at the University of Toronto.
Copying for purposes other than this use is expressly prohibited.
All forms of distribution of this code, whether as given or with

=== Module Description ===
This module contains sample tests for Assignment 2, Tasks 1 and 2.
The tests use the provided example-directory, so make sure you have downloaded
and extracted it into the same place as this test file.
This test suite is very small. You should plan to add to it significantly to
thoroughly test your code.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - If using PyCharm, go into your Settings window, and go to
      Editor -> General.
      Make sure the "Ensure line feed at file end on Save" is NOT checked.
      Then, make sure none of the example files have a blank line at the end.
      (If they do, the data size will be off.)

    - os.listdir behaves differently on different
      operating systems.  These tests expect the outcomes that one gets
      when running on the *Teaching Lab machines*.
      Please run all of your tests there - otherwise,
      you might get inaccurate test failures!

    - Depending on your operating system or other system settings, you
      may end up with other files in your example-directory that will cause
      inaccurate test failures. That will not happen on the Teachin Lab
      machines.  This is a second reason why you should run this test module
      there.
